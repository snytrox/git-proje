Didn't you know when you were loved? 
Didn't you laugh when I told you? 
Didn't I say that our fortune holds longing and separation? 
You wouldn't understand,
you wouldn't understand
You wouldn't even believe in fate
You couldn't be one of those heartless people who cause pain
I wish you happiness, my love
Even if I'm not there, may life smile upon you
The sin is on your shoulders
You left behind a pair of weeping eyes
